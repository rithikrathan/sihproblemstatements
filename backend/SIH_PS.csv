SIH1557,"Development of Tyre Maintenance and Operation App, including fitment of necessary IIoT related hardware in Dumpers",Hardware,Smart Automation,NULL,"Tyre cost is one of the most important O&M cost in dumpers. In high capacity dumpers of CIL, the tyres are imported ones, and cost of such tyre is more than Rs. 25.00 lakhs each. Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important. TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation. TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour) Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift. Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory. More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must. Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition. Tyre Pressure Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources. Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime. Tyre Performance Analysis Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres. Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.",Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited,Ministry of Coal

SIH1560,"Rapid colorimetric and artificial intelligence-based methods for determining the microbial quality of raw milk, processed milk, and milk products",Hardware,MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech,NULL,"Background: Milk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is the bacteriological quality of milk assumed to be. This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons. Description: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods. Expected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.",Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying,"Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying"
SIH1561,"Affordable, Sustainable, and User-friendly Solutions for Semen Dose Storage and Distribution",Hardware,"Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development",NULL,"Background: lndia has emerged as leading milk producer country in the world, however productivity of dairy animals is very low. To improve the productivity of animals a major focus area is to breed these animals using semen from high genetic merit bulls through Artificial lnsemination (Al). Al enables farmers to access the best bull (male) genetics. Farmers can improve the production, health traits, fertility and longevity of their dairy cattle by using a balanced approach to breeding. Animal health is also improved through the use of Al. Description: For Al, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery system in lndia.

SIH1562,Solution for end-to-end tracking of dual use chemicals used in both legitimate industries and illicit drug production from point of manufacture to point of end use/export.,Hardware,Blockchain & Cybersecurity,NULL,"Background: Dual use precursor chemicals are substances that have legitimate industrial and commercial applications but can also be used in the illicit manufacture of drugs. For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985. Description: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need for end-to-end tracking of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemicals (controlled substances) Expected Solution: A hardware/software/chemical solution for end-to-end tracking of dual use chemicals used in both legitimate industries and illicit drug production from point of manufacture to point of end use/export",Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB),Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)

The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this. Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example: 60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam 40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam 30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam. Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student’s responses.

SIH1580,Wearable sensor with Artificial Intelligence for prevention of falls in elderly people,Hardware,MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech,NULL,"Background: As per the census 2011, Disability is more common in elderly people. One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as “unexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,” are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual’s strength, balance, and mobility Description: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants’ presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people. Expected Solution: These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers",National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (NIEPID),Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment

SIH1606,Micro-Doppler based Target Classification,Software,Robotics and Drones,NULL,"Description: The world today has bought on a need to pay increased attention to safety and security issues, for example, search and rescue operations, surveillance, and protection of critical infrastructure. These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class. Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately. Detailed Description: Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis. A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification. Expected Solution: Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird Output: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)",SBU-BEL,Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)

SIH1624,To develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based model for electricity demand projection including peak demand projection for Delhi Power system,Software,Smart Automation,NULL,"Background: The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand. Description: The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs. Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.

SIH1645,An app and web based software for Productivity and safety management of coal mines.,Software,Smart Automation,NULL,"Background: Despite the thrust on energy transition from fossil fuel sector to a cost-competitive renewable energy sector, Coal will remain pivotal to energy security of the nation in near future. India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal. Description: The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines. A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization. The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift’s activities. Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life. Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same. This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine. Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. Possible Solution: An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines. Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.",Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited,Ministry of Coal

SIH1649,DDoS Protection System for Cloud: Architecture and Tool,Software,Blockchain & Cybersecurity,NULL,"Background: Many organization are using Cloud for hosting their web applications. The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks. • Description: The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS. Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack: 1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range 2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version 3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint 4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes) There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also. For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made: 1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users. 2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability). 3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS). 4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver. 5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure. A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack. Expected Solution: A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack. As high availability is an essential feature, the down time (recovery time) should be minimized to the extent possible.","SAG, DRDO",Ministry of Defence

Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. Detailed description: The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently.

SIH1657,Integrated Geo-Referenced Fish Catch Data Repository and Access System,Software,Smart Automation,Dummy Data sets will be provided during the grand fiNAle,"Background: INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis. Detailed Description: Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. Data input, classification and arrangement The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight. Users, Data output and visualization The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth. -In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence. Data Accessibility The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data. Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.",Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS),Ministry of Earth Sciences

The forecasts of surface winds can be provided by INCOIS. INCOIS will strive to provide any other data required.,"Background: Most of the goods are transported around the world by shipping which relies heavily on fossil fuels for powering. Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry. Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes. Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields. The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ. If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes. This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency. Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.",Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS),Ministry of Earth Sciences

Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html. Expected Solution: The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly. The solution should be suitable for windows and android environments (web and browser based) and scalable over the time by the host institute independently post-SIH",Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS),Ministry of Earth Sciences

SIH1682,Centralized Automated Solution for Price Estimation & Reasonability.,Software,Smart Automation,NULL,"2.1 Background: 2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs. 2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved. 2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ‘price reasonability’ for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors. 2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking. 2.2 Detailed Description: 2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows: i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates. ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price. iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey. 2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain. 2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach). 2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs. 2.3 Expected Solution: 2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness. 2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services. 2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user.

SIH1693,Developing a Robust Hydraulic Transient Analysis Model for Hydro Power and Pumped Storage Schemes.,Software,Smart Automation,NULL,"Background Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions.

NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies. As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin. Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological & hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River. Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling. The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems. Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological & hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network. a.

SIH1708,Tool for secure automatic network topology creation.,Software,Miscellaneous,NULL,"BACKGROUND: In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network. Problem Statement Details: “Develop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.” NOTE : GAIL (INDIA) LTD will not provide any hardware, software, license, data or any other resource to SIH hackathon Teams.

SIH1731,SolarQuest: Innovate to Capture More Sunlight and Boost Energy,Software,Clean & Green Technology,NULL,"As the global shift towards renewable energy intensifies, solar trackers, which adjust solar panels to follow the sun’s path, are crucial for maximizing solar energy efficiency. Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink®, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation.

SIH1746,Improving open source software security using Fuzzing,Software,Blockchain & Cybersecurity,NULL,"Background: Fuzzing is an automated process of identifying software vulnerabilities by supplying unexpected and faulty inputs to the software. The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps – 1. Identification of Target Function(s) – Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data. 2. Developing harness – Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input. 3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data inputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness. The fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a certain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory state of the crash to file for later analysis.

SIH1749,Recovery of Deleted Data and Associated Metadata from XFS and Btrfs Filesystems,Software,Blockchain & Cybersecurity,NULL,"Background : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery. Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence. Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data. Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms. Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to: 1.

The Post Office also merges Pincodes together to mechanise and streamline delivery in the emerging volume and mix of mail handled at different stages, including the point of delivery. An intelligent solution, powered by AI is needed to meet the dynamic design of the supply chain both for customers as well as operators within India Post.",Software,Transportation & Logistics,NULL,"Background: The Department of Post in India boasts the world's largest postal network, with over 165,000 post offices. Through nearly 19,000 pin codes across the country the postal network manages the delivery of postal items across its network. One common issue is the mismatch between the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on mail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery network design keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery Hubs are introduced to bring in more efficiency in operations. From the perspective of the customer, the challenge is two fold: (a) to know the correct Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of operations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain categories of mail is also a challenge. Though the customer does not need to bother about (b), the internal system of India Post needs to take care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery at all times. Description: Postal services are essential for various government, financial, educational, corporate, and public entities, both in urban and rural areas. Despite the widespread use of postal services, inaccurate addressing persists, hampering efficient delivery. Each mail item must clearly indicate the recipient's Delivery Post Office name and area Pin Code. However, inconsistencies in this information often result in misrouted mail, with approximately 5% of articles handled daily at distribution hubs containing incorrect Pin Codes. Even if correct Pincodes are provided as per information available with the customer, there is a mismatch in the internal operations as the constant upgradation of delivery network with Nodal Delivery Centres with merged pincodes etc makes it too dynamic for internal operators to keep pace with the changes. This leads to mistakes, delays and wasteful movement of mail pieces in the system. Expected Solution: An AI-based scanning solution is proposed to identify the correct delivery location for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. This system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret address information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office based on available data. By automating the identification process, this solution aims to improve last-mile delivery efficiency, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction. Having taken care of the first problem, the system is also expected to align with internal operational databases for clubbing and mapping of different pincodes for delivery purpose and thereby suggest the right destination for dispatch and delivery of the articles.",Department of Posts,Ministry of Communication

E-commerce organisations like Amazon,Flipkart, financial organisations like ICICI, HDFC etc are providing door step products/services with use of advanced technology like digital platform or machine learning through AI. This creates another level of acceptance across the world among the recipient for the organisation. This is becoming part of basic customer expectation and needs to be included in the Department’s common value proposition with the help of a robust system tied to its operational system. Description: India Post as the largest mail delivery organisation in India delivers articles/parcels at the door step of customer. The delivery is one of the key services the Department offers to the citizens of India. Department reaches last mile of delivery through its branches. The delivery process initiates at the booking Post office after receiving mails/articles. After sorting, the concerned Postman of the delivery Post Office has to reach to the recipient for delivering article mostly during the office hours, i.e. in between 10am to 5pm. In many instances, recipient cannot receive the article within that time range of the delivery due to his absence at the delivery address. In that case i) Post man either has to make 2nd attempt or next day delivery which falls within same time range orii) after unsuccessful delivery Postman has to serve intimation for next day delivery or for window delivery at Post Office by the recipient personally. In both cases, wastage of valuable working hours of the Postman happens for sure. Moreover, due to such incident, recipient has to take leave from his/her work as delivery time range/slot gets coincided with his/her working hours for collecting the article. In many cases article gets returned to sender because of non-availability of the addressee within time range of Postman delivery. This creates dissatisfaction on the delivery service among both Sender and Receiver of the article/consignment, thus lowering departmental performance index. Hence Department is losing the extra mile of delivery performance in the eye of customer of modern era as well as e-commerce like product oriented organizations who uses last mile unique delivery system of this organisation. Expected Solution: - At time of booking of any consignment sender should have option to select time slot for delivery and share the same with the recipient which can be modified by the sender online at any point of time before the date of delivery.

Problem Description Develop a system to automatically verify new title submissions by checking for similarities with existing titles in the database and ensuring compliance with specific guidelines. The system should reject titles that are too similar to existing ones, contain disallowed words, or violate other outlined rules. Additionally, the system should provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified. Requirements: 1. Similarity Check: a. Implement a mechanism to check for similar-sounding names using phonetic similarity algorithms (e.g., Soundex, Metaphone). b. Identify titles that have common prefixes or suffixes (e.g., The, India, Samachar, News). c. Ensure that variations in spelling or slight modifications do not bypass the similarity check (e.g., Namaskar vs. Namascar). d. Calculate a similarity percentage for each title comparison. 2. Prefix/Suffix Handling: a. Maintain a list of disallowed prefixes and suffixes. b. Reject any new titles that include these disallowed prefixes or suffixes if they cause the new title to resemble an existing title closely. 3. Guideline Enforcement: a. Maintain a list of disallowed words (e.g., Police, Crime, Corruption, CBI, CID, Army). b. Ensure that titles containing these disallowed words are rejected. c. Prevent the creation of new titles by combining existing ones (e.g., if ""Hindu"" and ""Indian Express"" exist, ""Hindu Indian Express is not allowed""). d. Check for titles with similar meanings in other languages and reject them (e.g., ""Daily Evening"" and ""Pratidin Sandhya""). e. Disallow adding periodicity (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to existing titles to form new ones. 4. Verification Probability: a. Provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified. 5. Database Interaction: a. Efficiently search and compare new titles against the database of 160,000 titles. b. Track current applications and use them for future reference to reject similar titles submitted later. c. Use indexing and optimised search techniques to handle the large dataset and ensure quick responses. 6. User Feedback: a. Provide clear feedback to the user if their submitted title is too similar to an existing title, contains disallowed prefixes/suffixes, violates guidelines, or is created by combining existing titles. b. Display the verification probability to the user. c. Allow the user to modify their title and resubmit it for verification. 7. Scalability: a. Design the system to handle an increasing number of titles and user submissions. b. Ensure that the system remains performant as the database grows. Expected Solution: 1. The system will provide the probability of a title being verified. For instance, if a title has a similarity score of 80%, the verification probability shall not be more than 100%-80%=20% 2. The system will reject any new title that is too similar to existing ones, contains disallowed words or prefixes/suffixes, combines existing titles, or has similar meanings in other languages. 3. The system will track current applications and use them for future reference, rejecting similar titles submitted later by other users. Acceptance Criteria: 1. Accuracy: a. The system correctly identifies similar-sounding titles and provides consistent results. b. The system accurately rejects titles with disallowed prefixes, suffixes, and words. c. The system prevents the creation of titles by combining existing titles and identifies titles with similar meanings in other languages. d. The system disallows adding periodicity to existing titles. e. The system provides an accurate verification probability score. 2. Performance: a. Title verification is completed within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 2 seconds per title). b. The system can handle multiple title verification requests simultaneously without significant performance degradation. 3 User Experience: a. Users receive clear and actionable feedback on why their title was rejected. b. Users see a probability score indicating the likelihood of their title being verified. c. The interface for title submission and feedback is user-friendly and intuitive. 4 Robustness: a. The system handles edge cases and variations in spelling effectively. b. The system is resilient to errors and provides meaningful error messages when issues occur.",Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
